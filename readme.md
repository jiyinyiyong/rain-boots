## Rain-boots wraps Bash as a better tool

for CoffeeScript developers.

------

Read my issues about my plan:  
https://github.com/jiyinyiyong/rain-boots/issues

This is in prototype development. Just collect my ideas here.

My goal is to demostrate a better solution than Grunt.  
I regard `rain-boots` as an abstraction on Bash and JSON.
